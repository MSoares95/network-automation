## üïí Lab 4: Configuring VLANs and Trunks with Ansible

## üéØ Objective
In Lab 4, we automate the configuration of VLANs and trunks on Cisco switches using Ansible. 
This exercise demonstrates how to manage multiple devices consistently, safely, and efficiently.

##‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Playbook

```yaml
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini playbooks/config_vlans_trunks.yml
```

The config_vlans_trunks.yml playbook is organized into three main sections:
- Variables ‚Äì Define VLANs and trunk ports.
- VLAN Creation ‚Äì Use the cisco.ios.ios_vlan module to create VLANs.
- Trunk Port Configuration ‚Äì Use the cisco.ios.ios_interface module to configure trunk ports.

## Variables:
```yaml
vlans:
  - id: 10
    name: "VLAN_10"
  - id: 20
    name: "VLAN_20"
  - id: 30
    name: "VLAN_30"

trunk_ports:
  - "GigabitEthernet0/1"
  - "GigabitEthernet0/2"
````

## Creating VLANs

Using a loop, we can create all VLANs consistently:
```yaml
- name: Create VLANs
  cisco.ios.ios_vlan:
    vlan_id: "{{ item.id }}"
    name: "{{ item.name }}"
    state: present
  loop: "{{ vlans }}"
```

## Configuring Trunk Ports

Trunk ports carry multiple VLANs between switches. The configuration is:
```yaml
- name: Configure trunk ports
  cisco.ios.ios_interface:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    mode: trunk
    trunk_vlans: "{{ vlans | map(attribute='id') | join(',') }}"
  loop: "{{ trunk_ports }}"
```

## ‚úÖ Verification

## Check VLANs
```bash
show vlan brief
```

## Check trunk ports
```bash
show interface trunk
```

## Check interface status
```bash
show interface status
```

## Conclusion

Automating VLANs and trunk configurations with Ansible brings consistency, efficiency, and scalability. By using variables and loops:
- Changes are applied across multiple devices simultaneously.
- Manual errors are minimized.
- The network is easier to audit and maintain.

This lab is a fundamental step toward real-world network automation, preparing you for enterprise-level tasks with confidence.
